9 networking protocols that we should have on our tips for coding interviews. 

► HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- Facilitates user requests for web pages.
- The server responds with the requested content.
-  Provides easy access to websites.
- Example: Viewing a page on Wikipedia.

► HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
- Encrypts data during transmission.
- Ensures secure communication between users and servers.
-  Safeguards sensitive data.
- Example: Using secure online banking or shopping sites.

► FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- Enables file transfers between computers over the internet.
- Supports uploading and downloading of files.
-  Allows for large file transfers.
- Example: Uploading content to a web server.

► TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Breaks data into packets and ensures their correct delivery.
- Guarantees the packets arrive in order and intact.
-  Provides reliable data transfer.
- Example: Fully loading a web page with all its elements.

► IP (Internet Protocol)
- Assigns unique addresses to devices.
- Directs data to its intended destination.
-  Ensures data reaches the correct device.
- Example: Sending an email to a specific address.

► UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Sends data without error-checking.
- Offers faster but less reliable transmission than TCP.
-  Facilitates quick data transfer.
- Example: Streaming live video or playing online games.

► SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- Transfers emails from one server to another.
- Routes messages through various servers to the recipient.
-  Efficiently delivers emails.
- Example: Sending an email to a colleague.

► SSH (Secure Shell)
- Establishes a secure connection to a remote computer.
- Enables secure control and file transfers.
-  Provides secure remote management.
- Example: Remotely managing a server via command line.

► IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
- Stores emails on a server for access from multiple devices.
- Allows synchronization of emails across different devices.
-  Keeps emails updated across all devices.
- Example: Checking your email on both your phone and laptop.
